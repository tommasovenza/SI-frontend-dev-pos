# Slideshow Web App

This web app it's an exercise to test candidate frontend skills.
I decided to develope the app using CSS3 and Vanilla Javascript, so no frameworks are involved.

## How to use

The app consisted in one main page.
There are two buttons on the header's app that users can press for creating
components.

Pressing the plus button user will create, initially, another button to upload an image each time inside component.
So component will become a slideshow that user can control with a slider place above all the images uploaded. More images will be uploaded more counter will grow.

If user want can create more slideshow pressing the plus button all time he wants.

There is also a minus button (-) for removing component and a switch button for changing layout's app.
