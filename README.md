# Slideshow Web App

This web app it's an exercise to test candidate front-end skills.
I decided to develop the app using CSS3 and Vanilla Javascript, so no frameworks are involved.

## How to use

The app consisted in one main page.
There are two buttons on the header's app that users can press for creating Components.

Pressing the plus button (+) user will create, initially, another button to upload an image each time inside the component.
So, the component will become a slideshow that user can control with a slider, placed above all the images uploaded.
More images will be uploaded, more counter will grow.

User can create more slideshow, pressing the plus button (+), all time he wants. If the user wants, can zoom images clicking on them.

There are, also, a minus button (-) for removing component, a switch button, for changing layout's app and a dark mode toggle for improving user experience.
